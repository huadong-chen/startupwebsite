	“I know there are many different cuisines from different regions in Singapore, but I don't know where I can find them near where I work and where I live. For someone like me who has a very busy schedule, it's hard to remember where they are even if I find them sometime. And I find that it is not easy to make myself get balanced nutrition from various foods.
	<br><br>
    Easy Eat Singapore helped me going through all those difficulties, and definitely made me enjoy my stay.”
